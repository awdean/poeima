At a high level, the basic structure of this utility is fairly simple:

  (1) Monitor the system clipboard for copied plain text.
  (2) Attempt to parse that text as Path of Exile (PoE) item copy data.
  (3) Extract the item's properties from the parsed item copy data text.
  (4) Identify which modifier classes could resolve to those properties.
  (5) Use constraint logic programming to identify combinations of specific
      modifiers that cover the entire set of item property values.
  (6) Make one (or all) of those combinations visible to the user.

The expected bulk of work lies in parsing over various formats of text,
mapping properties to hundreds of different modifiers, and mapping correctly
between several external and internal data types.
